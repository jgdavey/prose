// --- Day 9: Rope Bridge ---

// This rope bridge creaks as you walk along it. You
// aren't sure how old it is, or whether it can even
// support your weight.

// It seems to support the Elves just fine, though.
// The bridge spans a gorge which was carved out by
// the massive river far below you.

// You step carefully; as you do, the ropes stretch
// and twist. You decide to distract yourself by
// modeling rope physics; maybe you can even figure
// out where not to step.
