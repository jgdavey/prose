#+end_export

A CLI utility to reformat text.

=prose= is inspired by [[http://www.nicemice.net/par][par]], and aims to be similar, albeit with fewer
features, while also being Unicode-aware.

** Installation

*** Via pre-built binary release

Download the [[https://github.com/jgdavey/prose/releases/latest][latest release]] for your platform, extract, and put the
=prose= binary wherever you'd like.

*** Via cargo

If you're a Rust programmer, prose can be installed with cargo. Note
that the minimum supported version of Rust for prose is 1.38.0,
although it may work with older versions.

#+begin_src shell
cargo install prose
#+end_src

** Examples

:header-args:    :results raw output :exports both :wrap example

Given the following input, a [[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-morrison-davis-20140507-column.html][quote by Angela Davis]], on STDIN:

#+name: angela_davis
#+begin_example
I believe profoundly in the possibilities of democracy, but democracy needs
to be emancipated from capitalism. As long as we inhabit
a capitalist democracy, a future of
racial equality, gender equality, economic equality will elude us.
#+end_example

let's look at some invocations and their output.

As a baseline, we can view what a standard =fmt= would yield.

#+begin_src shell :stdin angela_davis
fmt -44
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
I believe profoundly in the possibilities of
democracy, but democracy needs to be
emancipated from capitalism. As long as we
inhabit a capitalist democracy, a future of
racial equality, gender equality, economic
equality will elude us.
#+end_example

Using the same width option, =prose= yields a less jagged output.

#+begin_src shell :stdin angela_davis
prose -w 44
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
I believe profoundly in the possibilities
of democracy, but democracy needs to be
emancipated from capitalism. As long as we
inhabit a capitalist democracy, a future of
racial equality, gender equality, economic
equality will elude us.
#+end_example

Using the same width option, =prose= yields a less jagged output.

*** Prefixes and suffixes (like code comments)

=prose= attempts to keep prefix/suffix line adornment--such as
borders, code comment marks, and indentation--intact.

Consider the the following input:

#+name: comments
#+begin_example
/* Lorem ipsum dolor sit ameÞ, sea ðicat instructíor deterrúisset cu, ex */
/* graéce scriptæ minimum eós. Nö qui plæcérat eloquentiam, alíenum */
/* sæluÞæÞus evertitur éam nö, mucíus tibíque ad esÞ. Atqui fêugâit eum */
/* id. Síngulis, id meí chöro essent. Íð æssentior moderatius intellégam */
/* næm, solet abhorreant ne cum. Qúod æssum intellegam ad vím, pró diam */
/* vítae nónumy ei, cúm inaní primís té. */
/*  */
/* Ex dicunt åssentiør eum, ad nusquam definiebæs qui, */
/* vidit åtqui per ut. Qui ut simul dicunt */
/* sålutændi. Dūō scaevōla vulputaÞe ut. Quō volupÞua rætiōnibus uÞ, et */
/* postulǽnt intellegǽt vitupērata vim. Primis legimus haȝemus sit æð, */
/* seæ hǣrum, fâcilisi, êum ôfficiis iudicabit âd. */
#+end_example

And the output:

#+begin_src shell :stdin comments
prose -w 44 -l
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
/* Lorem ipsum dolor sit ameÞ, sea        */
/* ðicat instructíor deterrúisset cu,     */
/* ex graéce scriptæ minimum eós. Nö      */
/* qui plæcérat eloquentiam, alíenum      */
/* sæluÞæÞus evertitur éam nö, mucíus     */
/* tibíque ad esÞ. Atqui fêugâit eum      */
/* id. Síngulis, id meí chöro essent.     */
/* Íð æssentior moderatius intellégam     */
/* næm, solet abhorreant ne cum. Qúod     */
/* æssum intellegam ad vím, pró diam      */
/* vítae nónumy ei, cúm inaní primís té.  */
/*                                        */
/* Ex dicunt åssentiør eum, ad nusquam    */
/* definiebæs qui, vidit åtqui per        */
/* ut. Qui ut simul dicunt sålutændi.     */
/* Dūō scaevōla vulputaÞe ut. Quō         */
/* volupÞua rætiōnibus uÞ, et postulǽnt   */
/* intellegǽt vitupērata vim. Primis      */
/* legimus haȝemus sit æð, seæ hǣrum,     */
/* fâcilisi, êum ôfficiis iudicabit âd.   */
#+end_example

It similarly attempts to preserve paragraph indentation:

Given this indented input:

#+name: angela_davis_indented
#+begin_example
    I believe profoundly in the possibilities of democracy, but democracy needs
to be emancipated from capitalism. As long as we inhabit
a capitalist democracy, a future of
racial equality, gender equality, economic equality will elude us.
#+end_example

#+begin_src shell :stdin angela_davis_indented
prose -w 60
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
    I believe profoundly in the possibilities of democracy,
but democracy needs to be emancipated from capitalism. As
long as we inhabit a capitalist democracy, a future of
racial equality, gender equality, economic equality will
elude us.
#+end_example

# Or when all lines are indented:

# #+name: fully_indented
# #+begin_src shell :stdin angela_davis_indented
# cat | sed 's/^/    /g' | prose -w 50
# #+end_src

# #+RESULTS: fully_indented
# #+begin_example
#         I believe profoundly in the possibilities
#     of democracy, but democracy needs to be
#     emancipated from capitalism. As long as we
#     inhabit a capitalist democracy, a future of
#     racial equality, gender equality, economic
#     equality will elude us.
# #+end_example

*** Email quotes

=prose= attempts to be smart about keeping email quoting levels, if
they are the recognizable format of =>= introducing each new quote
level. With the following example email input:

#+name: email
#+begin_example
Abby,

Whoops! Sorry about that. I forgot to export it as a PDF. Re-attaching
to this message. Again, let me know if you need anything else!

Bill

Abby writes:

#+end_example

And a just the width set:

#+begin_src shell :stdin email
prose -w 48
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

#+end_example

*** Using the fit option, "-f"

Without =-f=, the result works, but could look slightly less jagged on
the ends.

#+begin_src shell :stdin angela_davis
prose -w 58
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
I believe profoundly in the possibilities of democracy,
but democracy needs to be emancipated from capitalism. As
long as we inhabit a capitalist democracy, a future of
racial equality, gender equality, economic equality will
elude us.
#+end_example

A width parameter of 56 or so would get us there, and if we are okay
having the longest possible maximum line length be less than the
target (width) we specify, we can pass =-f=.

#+begin_src shell :stdin angela_davis
prose -w 58 -f
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
I believe profoundly in the possibilities of democracy,
but democracy needs to be emancipated from capitalism.
As long as we inhabit a capitalist democracy, a future
of racial equality, gender equality, economic equality
will elude us.
#+end_example

*** With markdown input

Take, for example, this portion of the Contributor Covenant Code of
Conduct:

#+name: markdown
#+begin_example

#+end_example

With a standard invocation:

#+begin_src shell :stdin markdown
prose -w 42
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

#+end_example

Notice how the bulleted list has been run together. To leave bulleted
lists and other formatting intact, use the =-m= or =--markdown=
switch. Doing so will interpret the input as markdown, only formatting
plain paragraphs.

#+begin_src shell :stdin markdown
prose -w 42 --markdown
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
