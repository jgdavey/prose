A CLI utility to reformat text.

`prose` is inspired by [par](http://www.nicemice.net/par), and
aims to be similar, albeit with fewer features, while also being
Unicode-aware.

release](https://github.com/jgdavey/prose/releases/latest) for your

that the minimum supported version of Rust for prose is 1.38.0,
